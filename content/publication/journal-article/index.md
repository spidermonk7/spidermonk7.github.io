abstract: This paper presents the first systematic exploration of the structure of task-ability space and its connection to task difficulty in the context of artificial general intelligence (AGI) evaluation. We propose TADDL-V, a novel framework for quantifying the difficulty of visual tasks to support comprehensive AGI evaluation. Our approach decomposes complex visual tasks into fundamental ability components and establishes quantitative measures of task difficulty. Additionally, we release AGI-V70, a curated benchmark set designed for testing diverse visual abilities across multiple domains. This work provides essential theoretical foundations and practical tools for advancing AGI evaluation methodologies.
