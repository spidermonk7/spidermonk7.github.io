summary: Invited presentation on consciousness and self-consciousness models in Conscious Turing Machines (CTM) framework.
abstract: 'Based on the previous works of Conscious Turing machine(CTM), we discussed the consciousness and self-consciousness of a CTM and gave clear definitions. We examined whether the CTM framework aligns with key definitions of human consciousness to evaluate its potential for generating awareness. Concerning some illusion and disorder phenomena, we created a possible model and workflow (the "MIT" model) to understand how those phenomena work in CTM, and thus grasp a glimpse of the generation of consciousness in CTM.'

This invited talk presented our research on consciousness and self-awareness models within the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM) framework. We explored fundamental questions about machine consciousness and proposed the "MIT" model to understand consciousness generation phenomena in computational systems.

The presentation covered:
- Clear definitions of consciousness and self-consciousness in CTM
- Analysis of how the CTM framework aligns with human consciousness theories
- The "MIT" model for understanding illusion and disorder phenomena
- Implications for artificial general intelligence development

This work contributes to the theoretical foundations of machine consciousness and provides insights into the computational basis of awareness.
