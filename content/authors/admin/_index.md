  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

<!-- I'm Joey Cui (Â¥îÁªçÊ¥ã), currently an undergraduate student at Yuanpei College, Peking University, studying General Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and large language models. I have worked on benchmark generation for evaluating LLMs in neuroscience-related tasks, fine-tuning large models (e.g., Falcon 3B/7B), and building multi-agent LLM systems. In Fall 2025, I will pursue an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning at the National University of Singapore. -->

I'm Joey Cui (Â¥îÁªçÊ¥ã), currently an undergraduate student at Yuanpei College, Peking University, studying General Artificial Intelligence. My research centers on understanding and explaining the essence of intelligence, with the long-term aspiration of contributing to the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on computational neuroscience, I aim to emulate the computational logic of biological intelligence through detailed models‚Äîstudying brain-inspired architectures, analyzing neural circuits, and simulating (or even training) biophysically detailed neuron models. My goal is to identify new research directions in intelligence science and develop approaches that are more fundamentally aligned with AGI.

Currently, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity in a neuroscience laboratory, where I hope to gain first-hand experimental and analytical experience. Such training will not only fill a critical gap in my background but also prepare me for future PhD applications.
