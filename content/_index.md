        My research focuses on understanding and explaining the essence of Intelligence, aspiring to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I pursue this goal through two complementary approaches:

        **Top-down**: Analyzing and interpreting intelligence from a macroscopic perspective, focusing on studies of intention, consciousness, and world models. I leverage existing AI technologies to explain and replicate intelligent phenomena.

        **Bottom-up**: Based on computational neuroscience, I aim to mimic the computational logic of biological intelligence through detailed models, including brain-like architectures, brain region analysis, and simulation of detailed neuron models.
        
        I am actively seeking internship opportunities in neuroscience laboratories to gain hands-on experimental experience. Please reach out to collaborate! ðŸ§
