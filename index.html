I am a Research Assistant at the Brain-Inspired Algorithmic Modeling Lab, Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, **Tsinghua University**.

My research centers on understanding the essence of intelligence and creating **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, approaching this from two complementary perspectives:

- **Top-down** --- intention, consciousness, and world models
- **Bottom-up** --- computational neuroscience and biophysically detailed neuron models

Previously, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from **Yuanpei College, Peking University**, where I was a member of the *Tong Class*.
