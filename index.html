I am a Research Assistant at the Brain-Inspired Algorithmic Modeling Lab, Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Tsinghua University.

My research centers on understanding the essence of intelligence and creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), approaching this from both top-down (intention, consciousness, world models) and bottom-up (computational neuroscience, biophysical neuron models) perspectives.

Previously, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from Yuanpei College, Peking University, where I was a member of the Tong Class.
