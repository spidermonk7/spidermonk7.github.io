## Abstract

This work proposes TADDL-V, a framework for quantifying the difficulty of visual tasks to support AGI evaluation. We are the first to explore the structure of the task-ability space and its link to task difficulty, providing a principled approach to measuring how challenging visual tasks are for artificial general intelligence systems.
