## Under Review

2. **Implicit Theory of Mind in LLM Agent Decision-Making** (TradeCraft)
   <br>Under review at ICLR 2026.
   <br>A multi-agent trade-and-craft game environment for probing high-order Theory of Mind, social reasoning, and strategic planning in both AI and human agents.

3. **ResearchGym: Evaluating AI Agents in the Full Scientific Inquiry Loop**
   <br>Under review at ICML 2026.
   <br>A diagnostic environment that formalizes scientific inquiry into interactive "Research Trees" (DAGs), simulating the full scientific inquiry loop from hypothesis formulation to result interpretation and belief updating.

4. **HelioX: A GPU-Native Framework for Simulation and Training of Biophysically Detailed Networks**
   <br>Under review at ICML 2026.
   <br>A GPU-native engine for high-performance simulation and scalable differentiable training of biophysically detailed neural networks, outperforming standard simulators (NEURON) by orders of magnitude.
