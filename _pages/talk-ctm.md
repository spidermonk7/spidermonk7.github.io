## Overview

The Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), proposed by Lenore and Manuel Blum, is a formal theoretical computer science model inspired by Global Workspace Theory that aims to capture the essence of consciousness computationally. In this talk, we dig deeper into CTM's consciousness and self-consciousness, offering a clear definition and proposing a concrete mechanism for how a CTM could generate self-awareness.

## Rationalization of CTM's Consciousness

We validated CTM's consciousness definition by mapping it against established theories of human consciousness (Velmans' experiential definition and Dehaene's dual-component framework). We extracted four key requirements and showed that the CTM architecture satisfies all of them:

- **Perception and comprehension** --- via sensors and the Model-of-the-World processor
- **Self-awareness** --- through fine-grained sensors and processors that model the CTM itself
- **Global and local information handling** --- via the STM broadcast and processor-level weight control
- **Self-monitoring** --- through the Sleeping Expert Algorithm's prediction-feedback-learning cycle

## Definition of Self-Consciousness in CTM

We argued that self-consciousness, like consciousness, is generated by a *procedure* rather than the activity of any single processor. The critical difference lies in the duality of self: the objective self ("me") and the subjective self ("I"), requiring both body experience and inner experience.

## The MIT Model

![MIT Model Architecture](/Talks/IJTCS_ConsciousTuringMachine/mit.png)

We proposed the **MIT** model --- a group of three specialized processors responsible for generating self-conscious awareness:

- **M** -- Model-of-the-World processor (MoTW): Constructs and maintains models of both the *inner world* (the CTM itself) and the *outer world* (the environment), using a weighted combination of sensory input (S) and accumulated knowledge (K)
- **I** -- Instruction-Generator processor (IG): Generates action instructions and behavioral outputs
- **T** -- Thought-Generator processor (TG): Produces internal thoughts, reflections, and reasoning

These three processors communicate via direct links (not just through the STM broadcast), enabling the tight information exchange needed for self-aware processing. The architecture diagram above shows how MoTW sits at the top, receiving input from sensors and other processors, while IG and TG operate below, all connected bidirectionally and feeding into the STM.

## Validation through Illusions and Disorders

We used real-world phenomena to test and explain how the MIT model operates within CTM, demonstrating that the model can account for cases where perception diverges from reality:

- **Visual illusions** --- how the MoTW's modeling function balances sensation vs. knowledge, explaining why illusions persist even when we know they are illusions
- **Phantom limb syndrome** --- how mirror therapy can update the MoTW's inner world model to alleviate phantom pain
- **Congenital phantom limb** --- how the MoTW can generate body representations even without prior sensory experience
