I am a Research Assistant at the Brain-Inspired Algorithmic Modeling Lab, Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, **Tsinghua University**. I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from Yuanpei College, Peking University (2021--2025), where I was a member of the *Tong Class*, an honorary pilot program specializing in AI.

## Research Interests

My research centers on understanding and explaining the essence of intelligence, with the long-term aspiration of creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I approach this from two complementary perspectives:

**Top-down:** Investigating intelligence from a macroscopic perspective, with a focus on intention, consciousness, and world models. I aim to leverage existing AI technologies to analyze, explain, and replicate intelligent phenomena.

**Bottom-up:** Drawing on computational neuroscience, I seek to mimic the computational logic of biological intelligence through detailed models --- studying brain-inspired architectures, analyzing brain regions, and simulating biophysically detailed neuron models.
