I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, **Tsinghua University**. I received my **B.E. in Artificial Intelligence** from Yuanpei College, **Peking University** (2021--2025), where I was a member of the *Tong Class*, an honorary pilot program specializing in AI.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. I aim to leverage AI to decode the brain's structural and functional complexity through a bi-directional approach: from a bottom-up perspective, modeling neurons as fundamental computational units; and from a top-down perspective, analyzing macro-scale brain dynamics using neuroimaging techniques (e.g., MRI, EEG). By bridging these scales, I hope to unravel the neural substrates of intelligence and contribute to computational therapeutics for neurological disorders.
