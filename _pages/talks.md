## Overview

The Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), proposed by Lenore and Manuel Blum, is a formal theoretical computer science model inspired by Global Workspace Theory that aims to capture the essence of consciousness computationally. In this talk, we dig deeper into CTM's consciousness and self-consciousness, offering a clear definition and proposing a concrete mechanism for how a CTM could generate self-awareness.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Rationalization of CTM's Consciousness

We validated CTM's consciousness definition by mapping it against established theories of human consciousness (Velmans' experiential definition and Dehaene's dual-component framework). We extracted four key requirements --- perception and comprehension, self-awareness, global and local information handling, and self-monitoring --- and showed that the CTM architecture satisfies all of them.

### 2. Definition of Self-Consciousness in CTM

We argued that self-consciousness, like consciousness, is generated by a *procedure* rather than the activity of any single processor. The critical difference lies in the duality of self: the objective self ("me") and the subjective self ("I"), requiring both body experience and inner experience.

### 3. The MIT Model

We proposed the **MIT** model --- a group of three specialized processors responsible for generating self-conscious awareness:

- **M** -- Model-of-the-World processor (MoTW): Constructs and maintains models of both the *inner world* (the CTM itself) and the *outer world* (the environment), using a weighted combination of sensory input and accumulated knowledge.
- **I** -- Instruction-Generator processor (IG): Generates action instructions and behavioral outputs.
- **T** -- Thought-Generator processor (TG): Produces internal thoughts, reflections, and reasoning.

These three processors communicate via direct links (not just through the STM broadcast), enabling the tight information exchange needed for self-aware processing.

### 4. Validation through Illusions and Disorders

We used real-world phenomena to test and explain how the MIT model operates within CTM, demonstrating that the model can account for cases where perception diverges from reality.
