## TradeCraft
*Multi-Agent Benchmark for Theory-of-Mind and Cooperative Reasoning* (Jan 2024 -- Present)
<br>Collaborative Research Project, supervised by Dr. Junqi Wang and Dr. Lifeng Fan

- Designed and developed TradeCraft, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark and simulation environment for evaluating Theory-of-Mind, cooperation, and competition among LLM-based agents
- Built multi-agent task pipelines integrating role assignment, planning, and social reasoning modules
- Manuscript under review at ICLR 2026

## FAB: Factory of Abstract-style Benchmark
*Independent Project* (Nov 2024 -- May 2025)

- Developed the first fully automated, low-cost benchmark generation framework for abstract-style evaluation across multiple academic fields
- Enabled scalable benchmarking of large language models using structured abstraction errors, covering semantic, structural, and factual variants
- Open-source on GitHub: [FAB Benchmark Repository](https://github.com/spidermonk7)

## Possible Models of Self-Awareness in Conscious Turing Machines
*Course Project, supervised by Prof. Lenore Blum (CMU) and Prof. Manuel Blum (CMU)* (Sep 2022 -- Dec 2022)

- Discussed consciousness and self-consciousness of Conscious Turing Machines (CTM) and proposed a possible model and workflow (the 'MIT' model)
