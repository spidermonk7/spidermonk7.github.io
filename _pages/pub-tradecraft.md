## Abstract

Theory of Mind (ToM) is often claimed to emerge in large language models, yet it remains unclear whether LLM-based agents implicitly rely on ToM during concrete decision-making rather than explicit verbal reasoning. We study this question in a multi-agent game environment designed to elicit strategic interaction and goal inference.

We introduce TradeCraft, a turn-based multi-player trade-and-craft game with publicly observable inventories and private crafting goals, where players trade items and synthesize new ones according to Minecraft-inspired rules until any target item is crafted.

## Key Findings

- Agents' behavior and belief expressions are systematically influenced by explicit ToM scaffolding
- Increasing ToM order yields two qualitatively opposite trends across models, revealing heterogeneous effects of higher-order mental state reasoning
- A lightweight social game combining cooperation and competition in a controlled, interpretable setting
- A quantitative ToM measurement protocol using structured ToM traces as item-wise value functions
